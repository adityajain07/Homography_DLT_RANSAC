# About
The aim of the project is to find homography between two image scenes using DLT along with RANSAC. Everything has been coded from scratch. The 'Collage Image' folder contains a collage of book images (skewed, rotated, translated, distorted) and some of the raw book images are present in 'Test Images' folder. The aim is to find homography between the test images and the collage image and given a test image, find its bounding box in the collage image.  <br/>
